# Contributing Guidelines
Brief guidelines to provide a quickstart when contributing. 

This repository is inspired by iproute2 on Linux. More information on the `ip` command can be found in the [man-page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip.8.html) and [iproute2-page](http://www.policyrouting.org/iproute2.doc.html).

## Developer Setup
To test your code it can be useful to create an alias with the following command in your terminal:
```bash
alias ip="<path-to-repo>/iproute2mac/src/ip.py"
```
To have it permanently add the above command to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file.

Changes should now immediatly take effect.
